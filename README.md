8-1 Journal

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  I chose to share my week 7 project about the grocery app. It is meant to display a list of items purchased, how often and how many times through out the day they were purchased and then produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased. and the problem I think it is solving is being able to read from two different programing languages in a fluid motion.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  What I did particularly well on this program was the structure and organization of the overall program.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could have enhanced the overall formatting of my cpp code. Ialso could have cleaned my captions up a little to be able to read more easily.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging aspect of developing my code was utilizing the correct commands of the starter code to call to the code I developed in my Python code. I will always be grateful for the drop in tutoring that snhu provides. It is a great resource. 
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Being able to incorporate multiple programming languages when developing a program is an immensly important skill to have.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I incorporated industry standards to ensure that the code I developed was readable and reusable, that my code was formatted well and incorporated in-line comments to explain what each section of the code is responsible for.
